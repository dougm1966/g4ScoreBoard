# PCPLScoreBoard Migration Plan: localStorage to IndexedDB

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Replace localStorage(base64) image storage with IndexedDB(binary) storage while keeping the exact same upload interface (click Upload, pick file, done).

**Why IndexedDB:** IndexedDB can store large binary blobs and avoids base64 overhead, providing substantially more storage headroom than localStorage inside OBS Browser Source (Chromium/CEF).

**Benefits:**
- No localStorage limits (currently ~5MB causing 2.27MB upload failures)
- No base64 encoding overhead (33% size reduction)
- Scales to 8-12+ advertising images
- Faster loading times
- **Zero user interface changes** - same buttons, same workflow
- Simple for other users to operate

## Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Define IndexedDB database schema (db name, store name, keys)
- [ ] Add a small IndexedDB storage wrapper (get/set/delete)
- [ ] Create backup/export path for existing localStorage images (one-time migration)
- [ ] Verify IndexedDB persistence in OBS Browser Source across restarts

### Tasks:

#### 1.1 IndexedDB Schema
- [ ] DB name: `pcplscoreboard`
- [ ] Object store: `images`
- [ ] Primary key: the existing logical key (e.g. `leftSponsorLogo`, `player1_photo`, `sponsorAd_001`)

#### 1.2 Persistence Testing (OBS)
- [ ] Store a test blob in IndexedDB
- [ ] Reload browser source (OBS)
- [ ] Restart OBS
- [ ] Confirm blob still exists and loads

#### 1.3 Migration Prep (from localStorage)
- [ ] Identify all current image keys in localStorage
- [ ] Create a one-time migration routine: localStorage(base64) -> IndexedDB(blob)
- [ ] Decide whether to keep localStorage as temporary fallback during rollout

---

## Phase 2: Upload System Updates (Keep Current UI)
- [ ] Keep current upload buttons and user workflow unchanged
- [ ] Replace base64-in-localStorage writes with IndexedDB(blob) writes
- [ ] Add 8-12 advertising image upload slots (keys) using the same mechanism
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow

### Tasks:

#### 2.1 Update Upload Functions
- [ ] Update `logoPost()` to store the uploaded file as a Blob in IndexedDB
- [ ] Update `playerPhotoPost()` to store the uploaded file as a Blob in IndexedDB

- [ ] Keep same error handling and user feedback

#### 2.2 File Management (Same UI)
- [ ] Keep existing delete buttons and interface
- [ ] Update delete behavior to remove the image from IndexedDB
- [ ] Update preview to show the stored image
- [ ] Maintain same user experience
- [ ] Test hide/show behavior for each image slot

#### 2.3 Display Integration
- [ ] Update image loading to use IndexedDB
- [ ] Test with current upload interface
- [ ] Verify BroadcastChannel messaging works
- [ ] Keep all existing UI elements unchanged

- [ ] Update `loadPlayerPhotos()` function
- [ ] Update `loadLogos()` function
- [ ] Update `loadLogo()` function

#### 3.2 Messaging System Updates
- [ ] Keep BroadcastChannel messages small (send "imageUpdated" + key)
- [ ] Modify control panel broadcast functions
- [ ] Update browser source message handlers
- [ ] Test real-time image updates

#### 3.3 Fallback Handling
- [ ] Add fallback to localStorage for migration period (optional)
- [ ] Handle missing files gracefully
- [ ] Add loading state indicators
- [ ] Test error scenarios

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all image locations
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] OBS integration testing

### Tasks:

#### 4.1 Functional Testing
- [ ] Test player photo upload/display (2 locations)
- [ ] Test sponsor logo upload/display (2 locations)
- [ ] Test slideshow logo upload/display (3 locations)
- [ ] Test browser compact logo (1 location)
- [ ] Test all deletion functions
- [ ] Test all replacement functions

#### 4.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure load times vs localStorage
- [ ] Test with large image files
- [ ] Test concurrent loading
- [ ] Verify memory usage improvement

#### 4.3 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test in OBS Studio browser sources
- [ ] Test with different OBS setups
- [ ] Test BroadcastChannel reliability
- [ ] Test with different network conditions

### IndexedDB Smoke Test Checklist (do this early)
- [ ] Upload a left sponsor logo in the control panel
- [ ] Verify it appears in the browser source
- [ ] Reload the browser source
- [ ] Restart OBS
- [ ] Verify the logo is still present
- [ ] Upload 8-12 ad images and verify they all persist

## Implementation Notes

### IndexedDB Structure
- Database: `pcplscoreboard`
- Store: `images`
- Value: Blob (stored file) plus minimal metadata

### Key Naming
- Keep existing keys for compatibility:
  - `leftSponsorLogo`, `rightSponsorLogo`
  - `customLogo1`, `customLogo2`, `customLogo3`
  - `player1_photo`, `player2_photo`
- Add ads:
  - `sponsorAd_001` ... `sponsorAd_012`

### Migration Mapping
| localStorage Key | IndexedDB Key |
|------------------|-------------|
| player1_photo | player1_photo |
| player2_photo | player2_photo |
| leftSponsorLogo | leftSponsorLogo |
| rightSponsorLogo | rightSponsorLogo |
| customLogo1 | customLogo1 |
| customLogo2 | customLogo2 |
| customLogo3 | customLogo3 |
| customImage | customImage |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risks:
- **Storage quota:** IndexedDB still has limits that vary by platform/OBS build
- **Persistence variability:** Some environments can clear site data (rare, but possible)
- **Migration complexity:** Risk of data loss during transition

### Mitigations:
- **Stay binary:** Store Blobs in IndexedDB (avoid base64 overhead)
- **Quota awareness:** Add a simple usage indicator and clear error messages on quota failures
- **Backup strategy:** Full localStorage backup before migration
- **Fallback system:** Keep localStorage as backup during transition (optional)
- **OBS testing:** Verify persistence across reloads/restarts early
