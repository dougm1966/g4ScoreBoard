# Phase 7 Verification Report

Generated: 2025-12-26

## Phase Definition

Phase 7 corresponds to layout goal tracking captured in:

- `07-layout-goals-from-upgrages.md`

This phase is about documenting UI layout improvements to implement after earlier phases.

## Verification Result

Status: COMPLETED (goals implemented)

### Evidence

- The goals are captured in `07-layout-goals-from-upgrages.md`, including:
  - Score buttons reorganized into two rows:
    - Row 1: `[ P1 +Score ] [ P2 +Score ]`
    - Row 2: `[ P1 -Score ] [ P2 -Score ]`
  - Shot clock row with 3 buttons side-by-side:
    - `shotClock30`, `shotClock60`, `shotClockShow`

## Notes

- [x] Score buttons are grouped as two rows (P1+ / P2+ then P1- / P2-)
- [x] Shot clock controls are grouped as a 3-button row (30s/60s/show)

## Remaining Work

If there are additional layout goals beyond the two listed above, they are not represented in this file and would need to be added/expanded.
