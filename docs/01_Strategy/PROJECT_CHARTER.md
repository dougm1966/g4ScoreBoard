**Title: PROJECT CHARTER - DOCK-IT.LIVE**

* **Mission Statement:** To provide a professional-grade, local-first broadcast scoring and graphics suite for independent streamers and tournament directors.
* **Core Value Proposition:** Dock-It delivers high-fidelity, synchronized OBS overlays without the need for cloud subscriptions or complex server setups.
* **Target Audience:** Billiards and Darts streamers, local sports leagues, and competitive gaming broadcasters.
* **Primary Goals:**
* **Portability:** Enable users to run the entire suite from a USB drive or local folder via `file:///` protocol.
* **Reliability:** Eliminate stream downtime caused by internet outages or external API failures through local persistence.
* **Scalability:** Create a modular "Plugin" architecture where new sports can be added as features without re-coding the core engine.


* **Success Metrics:**
* Zero-latency synchronization between the Master Control Dock and the Visual Overlays.
* Successful migration of legacy `g4ScoreBoard` assets into the modular `/src` structure.
