**Title: COMPETITIVE MATRIX**

* **Market Position:** Dock-It.live occupies the "Pro-Local" niche, sitting between basic browser-based scoreboards and expensive enterprise broadcast hardware.
* **Direct Competitors:**
* **Cloud-Based Overlays:** These require stable internet; Dock-It wins on reliability by being 100% local-first.
* **Built-in OBS Text GDI:** These are hard to style; Dock-It wins on aesthetics by using high-fidelity Tailwind CSS and dynamic HTML.


* **Key Differentiators:**
* **IndexedDB Logic:** Unlike competitors that use simple text files, Dock-It uses a robust database (Dexie.js) to track complex match states and sponsor impressions.
* **Modular Features:** The ability to swap between Billiards, Darts, and other sports while keeping the same core Controller.
* **Sponsor Engine:** Integrated advertising management that tracks exactly how many times a logo was displayed during a stream.


* **Competitive Strategy:** To provide the most "Professional" look with the "Simplest" local setup, targeting streamers who value ownership of their data and tools.
